## Read and Visualize

In this milestone, you'll use ggplot2 to visualize the distribution of age_left for a subset of the data. But before you begin, you'll need to import the animals data set. Unlike with Milestone 1, the animals data set has not been pre-loaded for you to use in R.


## Recreation

### Part 1 - Import

In the code chunk below, use a command from the arrow package to read in the animals data set.

* The animals data set lives in the file `animals.parquet` (think of parquet as just another file extension like .csv, or .doc), which is stored in the `data/intermediate_files` folder in your working directory.  However, this quarto document lives in a folder below the working directory, so when you call the file path you need to use "../" at the beginning of the path to tell it to look for the path beginning one level higher than where this quarto document is stored. 

* Save the data set as an object in your environment named `animals`.


```{r}
#| label: recreation-import
#hint the function to read in a parquet file is the same as the code to read a csv file except replace 'csv' with 'parquet'

animals <- read_parquet('../data/intermediate_files/animals.parquet')




```

### Part 2 - Visualize

Run the code chunk below to see a plot. Your task is to recreate this plot. 


```{r}
#| label: recreate-this
#| message: false

knitr::include_graphics("images/milestone02.png")
```

Use `ggplot()` in the chunk below to re-create the plot above. Before plotting, you will first need to filter your data set to only include observations from cattle where age_left is more than 1 year.


```{r}
#| label: recreation-visualize

graph <- animals |> 
  filter(age_left > 365) |>
  ggplot(aes(age_left)) +
  geom_histogram(color = 'red')

graph

```




## Extension

Using the code chunk below, investigate a research question about this data, using the visualization skills you learned this week. Some ideas:

1. How does the distribution of age_left differ between breeds? Consider exploring these distributions with other geoms.
2. What relationships do you see between age_left and other variables of interest in the data set?
3. [any other research question of interest]

Alternately, working with a data set of your own, complete the following: 

1. Read in your data
2. Filter your data using a logical test/condition 
3. Graph this data subset using at least one geom 



```{r}
#| label: extension

# simple graph
graph_breed <- animals |> 
  filter(age_left > 365) |>
  # show distribution of age left by breed
  ggplot(aes(age_left, fill = breed)) +
  # make it per year
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 365)+
  # start to make prettier
  scale_fill_viridis_d()+
  theme_minimal()

graph_breed


```

```{r}
#| label: fig-exention2

library(PupillometryR)

graph_breed_2 <- animals |> 
  filter(age_left > 365, breed %in% c("H", "X")) |>
  # show distribution of age left by breed
  ggplot(aes(breed, age_left, fill = breed, color = breed)) +
  geom_flat_violin(aes(color = breed),
                   alpha = 0.4
                   )+
  stat_summary(fun.data = median_hilow, 
               geom = "pointrange",
               size = 0.4,
               color = "darkgrey",
               position = position_nudge(x = -0.02)
  )+
  stat_summary(fun = median, 
               aes(label = paste("", round(..y.., 0))), 
               geom = "text", 
               size = 5,
               vjust = -0.08,
               color = "black",
               alpha = 0.8,
               hjust = 1.1,
               position = position_nudge(x = -0.04)
  )+
  # start to make prettier
  scale_fill_viridis_d()+
  scale_color_viridis_d()+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(x = "Breed Code")+
  theme(legend.position = "none")
